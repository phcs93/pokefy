# Pokefy
A tool for querying Pok√©mon with multiple filters.

All cached data (`pokemons-json.js`) was obtained from https://pokeapi.co/

:warning: Data for Generation 8 is incomplete (encounters missing).

# DEMO

# TO-DO
* improve current filters UX
  * lock which types can be filtered (multiselect)
  * lock which versions can be filtered (multiselect)
* implement more filters
  * by stats
  * by number of evolutions
  * by egg group
  * by moves learned
  * by ability
  * by weight
  * by height
* find a better spritesheet
  * remove `pokemons.css` (calculate the coords with the id)
* refactor all css and js
  * I may actually never do that since this project is only a POC
* team builder with moves & type vulnerabilites / advantages
* charts
  * type number
  * type effectiveness
  * natures & tastes
  * weather time (sword & shield)
